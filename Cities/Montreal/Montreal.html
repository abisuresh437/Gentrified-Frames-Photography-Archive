                        <p>Mather meticulously documented Montreal’s streets and architecture during a period of accelerated urban transformation. Her photographs capture neighborhoods before they were redeveloped, preserving images of disappearing buildings and shifting cityscapes. Her work highlights the gradual erasure of working-class communities and historic sites, offering a glimpse into a Montreal that was slowly being reshaped by modernization.</p>

                        <p>Walker focused on Griffintown, a former industrial district undergoing rapid redevelopment into a hub of high-end residential and commercial properties. His bold, colorful street photography captures the tension between past and present, showcasing construction sites alongside remnants of the neighborhood’s working-class history. His images document the visual chaos of gentrification, where historic structures struggle to coexist with luxury developments.</p>

                        <p>Lafrenière’s work explores the evolving identity of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, a historically blue-collar neighborhood experiencing gentrification. Through intimate portraits and street photography, she captures the lives of long-time residents, emphasizing the resilience of community identity amid rising property values and shifting demographics. Her work presents a human-centered perspective on gentrification, focusing on the stories and emotions of those affected.</p>
