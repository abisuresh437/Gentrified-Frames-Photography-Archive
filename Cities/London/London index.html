                        <p>Using a 1950s Rolleiflex camera, Holligan documented East London before it underwent significant gentrification. His work captured the everyday lives and architectural details of neighborhoods that were later transformed into trendy, affluent areas. His images evoke a sense of nostalgia and loss for the original character of these spaces, highlighting the social and cultural fabric that was eventually replaced.</p>

                        <p>Through his documentary film The Street (2019), Nelson explored the gentrification of Hoxton Street, a working-class neighborhood in Hackney. His project reveals the displacement of long-time residents, the rise of luxury developments, and the tensions between tradition and modernization. Nelson's work critiques the erasure of community identity and the social inequalities exacerbated by urban renewal.</p>

                        <p>Bush’s Metropole series (2015) used abstract photography to depict London’s aggressive redevelopment. His work focused on the visual and symbolic aspects of gentrification, showing the city as a place increasingly dominated by towering structures and privatized spaces. Bush's imagery reflects a dystopian perspective, questioning who the city is being built for.</p>

                        <p>Enkelmann’s seven-year project documented the transformation of Brixton, a neighborhood long known for its rich cultural heritage. His photographs capture both the vibrancy of the community and the challenges posed by gentrification, including rising rents and the displacement of local businesses. Enkelmann’s work offers a nuanced look at how residents adapt and resist amidst change.</p>
