                        <p>Sem Langendijk’s Haven (2022) is a deeply introspective project that examines displacement and gentrification in port cities, with a particular focus on Amsterdam. Combining urban landscapes and portraits, Langendijk reflects on the broader implications of urban development and the personal experience of people living in these transforming spaces. His photographs capture the tension between industrialization, urban renewal, and the cultural heritage that is often at risk of being lost in the process. Haven portrays the emotional and physical changes brought on by gentrification, highlighting the impact of these transformations on communities that once thrived in working-class areas.</p>
