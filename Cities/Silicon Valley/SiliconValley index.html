                        <small>South of Market, 1978 - 1986</small>
                        <p>Delaney’s South of Market series documents a time before the tech boom, when San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood was home to working-class families, artists, and small businesses. Her work captures the sense of community that existed before large-scale redevelopment projects displaced residents in favor of office buildings and upscale developments. Delaney’s photographs highlight the long history of gentrification in the Bay Area, showing that the struggle against displacement predates Silicon Valley’s rise.</p>

                        <small>Status Update, 2010s</small>
                        <p>Dundon’s Status Update series explores the housing crisis and gentrification in the Bay Area, particularly in Oakland and San Francisco. His work contrasts the wealth generated by the tech industry with the realities of eviction, homelessness, and community resistance. Dundon captures the stark divide between those benefiting from Silicon Valley’s expansion and those being pushed out, offering a raw and unfiltered view of the socio-economic shifts occurring in the region.</p>

                        <p>Takaichi’s Developers project takes a different approach, focusing on the people behind the tech industry itself. His images of tech workers in mundane, often isolated settings challenge the glamorous image of Silicon Valley. While not directly about displacement, his work offers an indirect critique of the industry’s role in reshaping the Bay Area, showing how the tech-driven economy has influenced the region’s urban and social landscape.</p>
