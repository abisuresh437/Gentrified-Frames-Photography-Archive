                        <p>Sciorio’s Portraits of Gentrification: Pilsen, Chicago series, shot in the early 2010s, highlights the shifting cultural landscape of Pilsen, a traditionally Mexican neighborhood in Chicago. Through intimate portraits of long-time residents, business owners, and community members, Sciorio captures the vibrancy and resilience of Pilsen’s working-class Mexican-American community, while also documenting the subtle yet pervasive effects of gentrification—rising rents, displacement, and the loss of cultural identity. His work is a powerful visual testament to the personal stories affected by the transformation of urban spaces.</p>

                        <p>Hidalgo, a native of Pilsen, turned his camera on the neighborhood he knew well, documenting the deep changes it was undergoing. His work, which focuses on both the architectural and human aspects of gentrification, illustrates the displacement of long-time residents and the community’s struggle to maintain its cultural heritage amidst growing economic pressures. Hidalgo’s photographs provide a heartfelt and poignant reflection of the residents’ feelings toward the changing environment, drawing attention to the human costs of urban renewal.</p>

                        <p>Ozernova’s Three Stories of Gentrification project takes a broader, more global approach to gentrification by documenting gentrifying neighborhoods in Chicago, San Diego, and Boston. Her work in Chicago highlights both the physical and emotional impacts of gentrification, as she captures portraits of local residents and business owners who are directly affected by the rapid urban transformation. Through her photos, Ozernova emphasizes how urban development projects often leave residents behind, focusing on the intersection of personal stories and larger socio-economic trends.</p>

                        <p>The LGNSQ project, which began in the early 2020s, focuses on the Logan Square neighborhood, an area experiencing significant gentrification. This project showcases a series of images that capture both the people who define the neighborhood and the places that represent its identity. The photography book delves into the tensions between new, wealthier residents and those who have lived in the area for decades, highlighting how gentrification is reshaping the community's cultural and social fabric. The photographs reflect a neighborhood caught in the throes of change, documenting both the nostalgia for the old and the emergence of the new.</p>
